# Ichigo Window Manager

> **一期** - *ichigo* - "one time, one meeting" - making every window arrangement perfect

Ichigo is a lightweight, efficient tiling window manager for Windows, inspired by the Japanese philosophy of appreciating each moment. Built in pure C using Windows APIs for maximum performance and minimal resource usage.

## 🌟 Features

```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Ichigo looks for `ichigo.conf` in the same directory as the executable. If not found, it uses sensible defaults.

### Example Configuration
```ini
# Window gaps in pixels
gap_size=8

# Enable automatic tiling
auto_tile=true

# Exclude specific window classes from tiling
exclude_class=Calculator
exclude_class=TaskManagerWindow

# Master-stack layout settings
master_ratio=0.6
master_count=1
```

### Finding Window Class Names

**Method 1: Debug Mode**
```bash
ichigo.exe -d
```
Watch the console output to see window classes as they're detected.

**Method 2: PowerShell**
```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.MainWindowTitle -ne ""} | Select-Object ProcessName,MainWindowTitle
```

**Method 3: Spy++ (Visual Studio)**
Use the finder tool to inspect any window's properties.

## 🎮 Usage

### Starting Ichigo
```bash
# Run in foreground with console output
ichigo.exe

# Run with custom config file
ichigo.exe -c myconfig.conf

# Run in debug mode (shows detailed logging)
ichigo.exe -d

# Show help
ichigo.exe -h
```

### Layouts

#### BSP (Binary Space Partitioning)
Recursively divides screen space, creating balanced layouts that adapt to any number of windows. Similar to i3 or bspwm.

#### Master-Stack
Traditional tiling with a master area (60% by default) and a stack area for remaining windows. Similar to dwm or xmonad.

#### Grid
Arranges windows in a uniform grid, perfect for monitoring multiple applications simultaneously.

#### Floating
Disables tiling for traditional window management. Individual windows can also be set to floating mode.

### Hotkeys Reference

| Hotkey | Action | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `Win + H` | Horizontal Split | Apply BSP layout with horizontal preference |
| `Win + V` | Vertical Split | Apply BSP layout with vertical preference |
| `Win + F` | Toggle Fullscreen | Make active window fullscreen or return to tiling |
| `Win + T` | Toggle Floating | Set active window to floating or return to tiling |
| `Win + Space` | Cycle Layouts | Switch between BSP → Master-Stack → Grid → Floating |
| `Win + M` | Move to Monitor | Move active window to next monitor |
| `Win + R` | Refresh | Re-apply current layout to all windows |

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

#### Window Hook System
Uses Windows Shell hooks (`WH_SHELL`) to monitor window events:
- `HSHELL_WINDOWCREATED` - Detects new windows
- `HSHELL_WINDOWDESTROYED` - Handles window closure
- `HSHELL_WINDOWACTIVATED` - Tracks focus changes

#### Layout Engine
Each layout algorithm operates on a per-monitor basis:
- **BSP**: Recursive binary partitioning with alternating split directions
- **Master-Stack**: Configurable master area with vertical stack
- **Grid**: Dynamic grid calculation based on window count

#### Multi-Monitor Management
- Automatic monitor detection using `EnumDisplayMonitors`
- Per-monitor layout state and window tracking
- Work area calculation respecting taskbar and other system UI

#### Configuration System
- INI-style configuration file parsing
- Runtime validation of all settings
- Support for comments and multiple value formats
- Graceful fallback to defaults for invalid values

## 🛠️ Development

### Building

**Debug Build (recommended for development):**
```bash
make debug
```
- Includes debugging symbols
- Enables console logging
- No optimization for easier debugging

**Release Build:**
```bash
make
# or
make release
```
- Optimized for performance
- Minimal size
- No debug output

**Clean Build:**
```bash
make clean
make
```

### Adding New Layouts

1. **Add layout type** to `LayoutType` enum in `ichigo.h`
2. **Implement layout function** in `layouts.c`:
   ```c
   void layout_my_new_layout(IchigoMonitor* monitor) {
       // Your layout algorithm here
   }
   ```
3. **Add case** to `apply_layout()` switch statement
4. **Update hotkey handler** for layout cycling in `hotkeys.c`

### Adding New Hotkeys

1. **Define hotkey ID** in `hotkeys.c`
2. **Add key detection** in `keyboard_hook_proc()` in `window_manager.c`
3. **Implement handler** in `handle_hotkey()` in `hotkeys.c`

## 📊 Performance

Ichigo is designed for minimal system impact:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Memory Usage** | < 1MB RAM |
| **CPU Usage** | < 0.1% (event-driven) |
| **Startup Time** | < 100ms |
| **Window Response** | < 5ms positioning |
| **Dependencies** | None (pure Windows APIs) |

## 🔧 System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit recommended, 32-bit supported)
- **RAM**: 1MB minimum
- **CPU**: Any x86/x64 processor
- **Permissions**: Standard user (administrator for system install)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Windows Not Tiling
1. **Check exclusions**: Verify window class isn't in `ichigo.conf`
2. **Window style**: Ensure window has `WS_CAPTION` and is resizable
3. **Visibility**: Window must be visible and not minimized
4. **Debug mode**: Run with `-d` flag to see detection logs

### Hotkeys Not Working
1. **Conflicting software**: Check for other programs using Win+ combinations
2. **Administrator mode**: Some security software requires elevated privileges
3. **Hook installation**: Check console for hook installation errors

### Multi-Monitor Issues
1. **Display changes**: Restart Ichigo after connecting/disconnecting monitors
2. **Work area**: Check if taskbar position affects window placement
3. **Monitor detection**: Use debug mode to verify monitor enumeration

### Performance Issues
1. **Window count**: Large numbers of windows (>50) may slow layout calculation
2. **Rapid changes**: Minimize window creation/destruction frequency
3. **System resources**: Ensure adequate RAM and CPU availability
